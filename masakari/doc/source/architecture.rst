Masakari System Architecture
============================

Masakari is comprised of two services api and engine, each performing different
functions. The user-facing interface is a REST API, while internally Masakari
communicates via an RPC message passing mechanism.

The API servers process REST requests, which typically involve database
reads/writes, sending RPC messages to other Masakari engine,
and generating responses to the REST calls.
RPC messaging is done via the **oslo.messaging** library,
an abstraction on top of message queues.
Masakari engine will run on same host where masakari api is running, and have
a `manager` that is listening for `RPC` messages.
The manager also, optionally, has periodic tasks.

Components
----------

Below you will find a helpful explanation of the key components
of a typical Masakari deployment.

* DB: sql database for data storage.
* API: component that receives HTTP requests, converts commands and
       communicates with masakari engine via the **oslo.messaging** queue.
* Engine: Executes recovery workflow and communicates with nova via HTTP.
