    Operators can now purge the soft-deleted records from the database tables.
    Added below command to purge the records:

      ``masakari-manage db purge --age_in_days <days> --max_rows <rows>``

    NOTE: ``notifications`` db records will be purged on the basis of ``update_at``
    and ``status`` fields (finished, ignored, failed) as these records will not be
    automatically soft-deleted by the system.
