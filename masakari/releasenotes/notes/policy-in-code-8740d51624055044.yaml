    Masakari now support policy in code, which means if operators doesn't need to
    modify any of the default policy rules, they do not need a policy file.
    Operators can modify/generate a ``policy.yaml.sample`` file which will override
    specific policy rules from their defaults.

    Masakari is now configured to work with two oslo.policy CLI scripts that
    have been added:

    - The first of these can be called like
      ``oslopolicy-list-redundant --namespace masakari`` and will output a list of
      policy rules in policy.[json|yaml] that match the project defaults. These
      rules can be removed from the policy file as they have no effect there.
    - The second script can be called like
      ``oslopolicy-policy-generator --namespace masakari --output-file policy-merged.yaml``
      and will populate the policy-merged.yaml file with the effective policy.
      This is the merged results of project defaults and config file overrides.

    NOTE: Default `policy.json` file is now removed as Masakari now uses default
    policies. A policy file is only needed if overriding one of the defaults.
