    Operators can decide whether error instances should be allowed for
    evacuation along with other instances from a failed source compute node
    or not. Added a new config option ``ignore_instances_in_error_state`` to
    achieve this. When set to True, masakari will skip the recovery of error
    instances otherwise it will evacuate error instances as well from a failed
    source compute node.

    To use this feature, following config option need to be set under
    ``host_failure`` section in 'masakari.conf' file::

        [host_failure]
        ignore_instances_in_error_state = False

    The default value for this config option is set to False.
