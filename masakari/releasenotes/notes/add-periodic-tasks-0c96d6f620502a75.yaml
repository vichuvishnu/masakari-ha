    Added _process_unfinished_notifications to process notifications
    which are in error or new state. This periodic task will execute at
    regular interval defined by new config option
    'process_unfinished_notifications_interval' defaults to 120 seconds. The
    notifications which are in ‘new’ status will be picked up based on a new
    config option ‘retry_notification_new_status_interval’ defaults
    to 60 seconds.

    To change the default execution time of periodic task, following config
    option needs to be set with desirable time under 'DEFAULT' section in
    'masakari.conf' file::

        [DEFAULT]
        process_unfinished_notifications_interval = 120

    To change the default identification time of notifications which are stuck
    in 'NEW' state, following config option needs to be set with desirable
    time under 'DEFAULT' section in 'masakari.conf' file::

        [DEFAULT]
        retry_notification_new_status_interval = 60
