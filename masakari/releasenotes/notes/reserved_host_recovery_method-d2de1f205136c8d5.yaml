    Implemented workflow for 'reserved_host' recovery method in case of host
    failure. Now operator can create or update failover segment with
    'reserved_host' recovery method along with the existing 'auto' method.
    When 'reserved_host' recovery_method is set to a failover segment,
    operators should also add one or more hosts with reserved flag set as True.
