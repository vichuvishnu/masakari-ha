    Fixes `bug 1693728`_ which will fix the race condition where after
    evacuation of an instance to other host user might perform some actions on
    that instance which gives wrong instance vm_state to ConfirmEvacuationTask
    that results into notification failure.

    To fix this issue, following config option is added under ``DEFAULT``
    section in 'masakari.conf' file::

        [DEFAULT]
        host_failure_recovery_threads = 3

    This config option decides the number of threads going to be used for
    evacuating the instances.
