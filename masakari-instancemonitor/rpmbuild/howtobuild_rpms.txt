Building:
Install the build tools,
$sudo yum install rpm-build rpmdevtools

sets up an RPM build area in your ~/rpmbuild directory. This directory will contain several subdirectories, for the project source code, RPM configuration files and for the resulting source and binary packages. 

Assume that https://github.com/ntt-sic/masakari.git is cloned.

First, create rpm build tree
$rpmdev-setuptree
if fails,
$mkdir -p ~/rpmbuild/{BUILD,RPMS,SOURCES,SPECS,SRPMS}

$cd masakari
$tar czvf masakari-instancemonitor.tar.gz masakari-instancemonitor --exclude='masakari-instancemonitor/debian' --exclude='masakari-instancemonitor/rpmbuild'
$mv masakari-instancemonitor.tar.gz ~/rpmbuild/SOURCES/
$cp masakari-instancemonitor/rpmbuild/SPECS/masakari-instancemonitor.spec ~/rpmbuild/SPECS/
$cd ~/rpmbuild/SPECS/
$rpmbuild --bb masakari-instancemonitor.spec

rpms are in,
$ls -l ~/rpmbuild/RPMS/<ARCH>
# Substitute "ARCH" for your architecture
